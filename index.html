<h1>post.1</h1>
<p>this week was web-dev heavy. i've had very limited exposure to coding a website manually. i can remember coding a page in html back in 1996 and doing web design in a limited way back in college using dreamweaver. this is all pretty new to me. i think i was designing in an era where css and html were integrated into one file.</p>
<p>html really only refers to the content of the page. styling within html isn't really done anymore. with the development of css, web styling is all done in a separate file which can be modified or swapped out without affecting the content of the page.</p>
<p>css is built on a system of selection. you can id specific elements, or groups -- called classes, that you have tagged in the html to specify what element you want to style.</p>
